# GitHub Pages Setup Guide

This guide explains how to publish a static website using GitHub Pages from your GitHub repository. Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages and view your HTML/CSS files live.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Ensure you have a GitHub account.
2. **Repository**: You need a GitHub repository with HTML and CSS files to host as a website.
3. **GitHub Plan**:
   - For **public repositories**, GitHub Pages is available on any plan, including free.
   - For **private repositories**, GitHub Pages requires a paid plan (GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise).

## Steps to Publish Your GitHub Pages Site

### Step 1: Create or Choose a Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2. Either **create a new repository** or **use an existing one** that contains the files you want to host.

### Step 2: Add Your Files

1. Upload your HTML, CSS, and any other static files (e.g., images, JavaScript) to the repository.
2. Ensure that your main file is named `index.html` (this will be the homepage).

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to the **Settings** of your repository.
2. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
3. Under **Source**, choose the branch you want to use for the GitHub Pages site, usually `main` or `master`.
4. If your files are in a specific folder (like `/docs`), specify that folder as the source.
5. Click **Save**.

GitHub will automatically generate a URL for your site, which will look like:

> https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/


### Step 4: Publish Your Site from a Private Repository (Paid Plans Only)

For private repositories, follow the same steps above if you have a paid GitHub plan (Pro, Team, or Enterprise). When GitHub Pages is enabled for a private repository:

- **Public Access**: By default, the site will be publicly accessible.
- **Private Access (Enterprise Only)**: If you use GitHub Enterprise, you can restrict site access to specific users or teams.

> **Note**: Ensure that no sensitive information is included in your HTML/CSS files, as publishing them will make them accessible online.

### Step 5: Access Your Live Site

After a few minutes, your site will be available at the URL generated by GitHub Pages (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`).

Visit the URL to see your site live! Any changes you make to the repository will automatically be reflected after you push the updates to GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: If you see a "404 Not Found" error, ensure that you specified the correct branch and folder in the GitHub Pages settings.
- **Site Not Updating**: If changes to your files aren't reflected, try clearing your browser cache or wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update.
